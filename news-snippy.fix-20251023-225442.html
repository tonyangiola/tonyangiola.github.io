    <p><em>“What is a Snippy?”</em> That curious question recently came from a well-known figure in the UFO/UAP world who, despite their recognition, had never heard of the infamous case of Snippy the Horse.</p>

    <p>If you’re a MUFON investigator, or an enthusiast of UFOs, cryptids, and high strangeness, the following account draws on unsealed APRO files preserved at the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, NM — uncovering the hidden truth behind one of the most important mutilation cases in history.</p>

    <h2>The Valley of Shadows</h2>
    <p>The San Luis Valley’s reputation for high strangeness became globally recognized with the Snippy case — the first animal mutilation to gain worldwide attention. Nearby residents reported luminous objects near Mount Blanca, craft over the Sand Dunes, and fast-moving orbs.</p>

    <h2>The Horses</h2>
    <p>Snippy was a 3-year-old Appaloosa gelding in 1967, gifted to Nellie Lewis and later kept between the Lewis cabin and the King Ranch. Other horses on the King Ranch included Smokey, Sheiba, and Lady.</p>

    <h2>Confusion over Identity</h2>
    <p>Over time, Snippy was often mixed up with Lady. Photographic evidence and examination of the bones confirmed Snippy was male—corroborated by witnesses present during the 1967 investigation.</p>

    <h2>Discovery & Forensics</h2>
    <p>On September 9, 1967, Snippy’s remains were found: flesh removed from the neck up with a cauterized collar-like incision, dry vertebrae and skull, and no blood. Forensic inspection reported organs removed without blood, a dry brain cavity, white powder in the stomach, and a possibly broken hind leg consistent with a fall from height.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Anomalies</h2>
    <p>Investigators noted a green ooze, an odd “tool,” scorch marks, cylindrical ground holes, large circular impressions, and fence posts seemingly severed by extreme heat—suggesting the presence of a massive object.</p>

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>Following the investigation, sudden deaths and ongoing reports of bloodless animal deaths, craft sightings, missing time, and other anomalies continued across the valley.</p>

    <h2>Closing</h2>
