<h2>Confusion Over Identity</h2>
<p>Over the years, Snippy’s name and even his sex became muddled. When we once mentioned “Snippy” at the UFO Watchtower and referred to him as male, we were quickly corrected: “Snippy was really Lady, a mare.” This confusion can be traced back to Berle Lewis, who decades later introduced new information that contradicted earlier reports.</p>
<p>APRO’s own files show inconsistencies, with pronouns shifting between male and female, and later sources incorrectly linking Snippy with Lady. Yet photographs from the time tell a different story. In one image, investigator Alice Richmond stands with Lady and Sheiba—both alive after Snippy’s death—contradicting Berle’s later claims. How is Lady alive after Snippy’s death if Berle was accurate?</p>
