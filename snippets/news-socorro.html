      <h2>Socorro UFO: Not of This Earth — The Day Officer Zamora’s World Changed Forever</h2>

      <p>On <strong>April 24th, 1964</strong>, <strong>Socorro Police Officer Lonnie Zamora</strong> was out on patrol in the quiet desert town of Socorro. It was a clear, bright late afternoon — until something extraordinary cut through the calm and changed UFO history forever.</p>

      <p>Lonnie was on <strong>random patrol</strong> — no fixed route, no schedule. That single fact makes this case exceptionally hard to stage or fake.</p>

      <p>Around <strong>5:50 PM</strong>, after radioing dispatcher <strong>Nep Lopez</strong> about a speeding car, Lonnie heard a <strong>roaring sound</strong> and saw a <strong>brilliant blue conical flame</strong> high in the sky toward the <strong>Rio Grande River</strong>, descending toward the desert.</p>

      <p>At nearly the same time, a <strong>family of four</strong> driving <strong>south from Albuquerque toward Socorro</strong> witnessed that same phenomenon. As documented by <strong>Ray Stanford (NICAP)</strong>, a bright <strong>blue-white flame</strong> passed directly over their car — so low it <strong>nearly clipped their radio antenna</strong>. Shaken, they pulled into <strong>Opal Grinder’s (Whiting Brothers)</strong> gas station moments later and saw a Socorro police cruiser racing south — <strong>Officer Zamora</strong>, pursuing the very object they had just seen.</p>

      <p>Lonnie turned off road toward the <strong>old dynamite shack</strong>. After several attempts, his patrol car crested a hill — and he saw it: a <strong>smooth, oval-shaped craft</strong> resting silently on the desert floor. The <strong>side facing him appeared tilted downward</strong>, as if one end had settled into the sand. Two small figures in <strong>white coveralls</strong> were present — one crouched near the object, the other beside a <strong>four-foot creosote bush</strong>. When the second figure noticed Lonnie, it withdrew from sight.</p>

      <p>Lonnie advanced, exited his vehicle, and approached to about <strong>30 feet</strong> — close enough for a <strong>clear, unobstructed view</strong>. He heard a sharp <strong>metallic hatch slam</strong>. The figures were gone. On the side of the craft he saw a <strong>bright red insignia</strong>: an <strong>inverted “V” with three horizontal bars</strong>.</p>

      <p>Without warning, a <strong>blue-white flame</strong> blasted downward with a <strong>deafening roar</strong>. The craft rose vertically to about <strong>20 feet</strong>, then went quiet, emitted a faint <strong>high-pitched whine</strong>, moved <strong>smoothly and horizontally</strong> across the desert (passing the dynamite shack), then <strong>angled up ~45°</strong> and accelerated to what Lonnie later described as <strong>supersonic speed</strong>, vanishing into the clear New Mexico sky.</p>

      <p><strong>Sgt. Sam Chavez</strong> arrived within minutes and glimpsed the object high above before it disappeared. Additional witnesses — <strong>Paul Kies</strong> and <strong>Larry Kratzer</strong> — reported the object from other vantage points around Socorro that afternoon.</p>

      <p>The case was investigated by <strong>Project Blue Book</strong>, <strong>Dr. J. Allen Hynek</strong>, <strong>APRO</strong> (Jim &amp; Coral Lorenzen), and <strong>Ray Stanford of NICAP</strong>. Decades later, we revisited the evidence with Stanford’s cooperation, connecting Socorro to similar cases — including <strong>La Madera</strong> (days later) and <strong>Lovelland, Texas (1957)</strong> — describing nearly identical craft.</p>
